<h1>WILDFIRES</h1>

<p>Wildfires burn thousands of acres in Arizona annually causing injury to people, and damaging property and the environment. Dry conditions at various times of the year greatly increase the potential of wildfires. People who own homes in or near forested/grassy areas are vulnerable to these destructive fires. You can protect yourself, your homes and your businesses from wildfires by following these basic tips:</p>

<li>Place woodpiles and wooden picnic tables away from structures; and</li>
