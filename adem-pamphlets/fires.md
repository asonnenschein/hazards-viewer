# WILDFIRES

Wildfires burn thousands of acres in Arizona annually causing injury to people, and damaging property and the environment. Dry conditions at various times of the year greatly increase the potential of wildfires. People who own homes in or near forested/grassy areas are vulnerable to these destructive fires. You can protect yourself, your homes and your businesses from wildfires by following these basic tips:

## CREATE AND MAINTAIN A DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUND YOUR HOME AND OTHER OUTDOOR STRUCTURES

- Thin and remove vines, tress, shrubs, tall grass and other flammable vegetation within 30 feet of your home;
- Prune bushes and shrubs, remove dead leaves and overhanging branches;
- Regularly clean your roof and gutters by removing leaves, branches and pine needles/cones;
- Remove trash and debris near your property;
- Landscape with fire resistant plants;
- Place woodpiles and wooden picnic tables away from structures; and
- Store combustible or flammable materials in approved safety containers away from structures.

## CREATE A SECONDARY SAFETY ZONE AT LEAST 125 FEET AROUND STRUCTURES

- Remove fallen trees and firewood debris;
- Trees or bushes should be thinned to maintain 10 feet between tree canopies;
